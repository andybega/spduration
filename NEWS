spduration 0.8
--------------

BUG FIXES

* buildDuration() would drop events that occurred during the first time period of a series, due to the way that onset was coded, e.g. incidence of (1,0,0,0,1) would become one spell that ends in failure after t=4, rather than two spells, both of which end in failure at t=1 and t=4. This has been fixed.
* Expanded manual for plot.spdur().
* Set correct values for last and max.iter defaults in spdur()


spduration 0.7
--------------

BUG FIXES

* buildDuration() now works with monthly and yearly data, and will stop if any
  key variables are missing values (NA).
* Minor fix in sploglog().

spduration 0.6
--------------

NEW FEATURES

* `AIC` and `BIC` methods for assessing models. 
* `logLik`, and `nobs` methods, used in computing AIC and BIC.
* `predict` and `forecast` methods now have more options for which statistic to create,
  as documented in the respective help files.

BUG FIXES

* `spdur.crisp` had incorrect default statistic and problem passing value.

--------------

NEW FEATURES

* `spdur.crisp` wrapper the replicates functionality of the original `wicews::spdur`
  and `crisp::spdur` functions.
